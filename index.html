            <h2>A Brief Introduction about Me</h2>
            <p>I am Ziyang Jin, a full-time airlines employee and part-time computer science student. </p> 
            <p>I was born in 1994, and I am the only kid in the family so I enjoy all the love from my parents, however, sometimes inevitably lonely. Because of the love of aviation, I went to study the Air Transport Engineering in Nanjing. I was graduated in 2016 and joined Hainan Airlines. I have worked for airlines as Flight Controller and Station Operation Manager in several cities in China(Tianjin, Beijing, Nanjing, Haikou), Australia (Sydney, Cairns) and United States (Las Vegas, Boston, Los Angeles, Nashville, Houston). Although the work is intense sometimes, I really enjoy this journey. However, due to the covid, we have to cut off most international flights. I enrolled the Software Development Program in Boston University in 2020 to prepare for a career transition.</p>
            <p>Due to the job characteristics, I have to move quite often. Therefore, I have a minimalist lifestyle and I am professional in apartment hunting and moving. I can pack all of my stuff and get ready for new departure within 1 hour. I am also an amature photographer and audio book reader. I am fascinated by the amazing national parks in the United States and I get most of the stunning pictures here. Also, I have an audio book channel in China and I regularly upload new episodes. I plan to launch it in Youtube and maybe my own website one day.</p>
            <p>Thanks for visiting me. Wish you all the best.</p>
